= Reading grades from text source

To be able to insert student grades into progress, the teachers want to be able to copy and paste
grades from a spreadsheet (which is the typical way grades are assembled) into a text area.
In this exercise, a simple file will do as the source of the grades, because working with a real clipboard is a project in itself.

In this exercise you have to test and implement the `GradeCapture`. 
The `GradeCapture` is used to extract the student number and the grade (if present) out of a whitespace separated file using a regular expression.

We have the following properties:

* Whitespace is used as a column separator
* The student number consists of seven consecutive digits and is always in the first column
* The grade consists of one digit (7), two digits (10), or two digits separated by either a dot (7.8) or a comma (7,9) and is always in the last column
* The number of columns is not fixed and may change per row
* When no grade is found in the input line, and the getResult method is invoked anyway, the result should contain  key=`null`  and value =`null`.
** So both the `grade` and `studentId` methods should in that case return `null`

== TODO

1. Implement the tests in `GradeCaptureTest`
** In `testGetResult` use https://fontysvenlo.github.io/prc2/docs/unit-testing-basics/#_soft_assertions[SoftAssertions] to test both when the regex should match and when the regex shouldn't match
2. Implement the regular expression in `GradeCapture` that captures the student number in one capture group and the grade (if present) in the second capture group
3. Implement the other method in `GradeCapture` in order

== Test data

Below is a table of test data that can be used.

* Test input: the input that can be used to test the regex
* Should match: whether the regex should match on the test input
* Found grade: the grade as captured by the regex
* Found snummer: the student number as captured by the regex
* Grade: the converted grade to a `double`

== Hints

You can use the following regular expression patterns

* `^`: Start of a line
* `$`: End of line
* `[0-9]` or `\d`: Matches digits
* `.`: Matches any character
* `\s`: Matches any whitespace
* `()`: Capture group
* `[]`: Matches single character within the brackets
* `*`: Matches previous expression zero or more times
* `+`: Matches previous expression one or more times
* `{n}`: Matches previous expression n times
* `?`: Matches the previous expression zero or one time
* `|`: Matches either the expression before or after

Use a website like https://regex101.com/[https://regex101.com/] to help build the regular expression.

You can copy the following test data into the `test string`
